# Outlier_Robust_Regression_Models
A comparison of four outlier-robust regression formulations using mixed integer optimization in Julia

This code was written by Ali Borenstein and Austin Zaccor as part of a final project in Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens at MIT as part of their Masters of Business Analytics degree. Please reach out to either of us on github or LinkedIn with questions about the code or mathematical formulations. As mentioned in the main file, publication is forthcoming.
